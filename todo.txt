bDeviceClass set to 0, see spec 1.1: Table 9-7 (it must be 0, then specified by the interface)
Find out if i need 2 configs and 3 interfaces or 1 config for all?

FIX EP/EPIN number (if necassary when also changing the interface number)
FIX interface and config indexes (remember interface number is relative to each config)


Notes:
